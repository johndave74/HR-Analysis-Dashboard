Some key findings and possible reasons include:

Job Roles: Significant attrition among Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives might be due to high job stress, demanding work conditions, or better opportunities elsewhere.
Education Level: Employees with Bachelor's Degrees tend to leave the most, possibly because they have a broader range of job opportunities and may be seeking career advancement or higher salaries.
Age Bracket: The age group 26-35 has the highest turnover, particularly among males. This could be attributed to career exploration, desire for better work-life balance, or family considerations.
Business Travel: Employees who rarely travel for business show higher attrition rates, which might suggest a lack of engagement or dissatisfaction with limited professional development opportunities.
Distance from Home: Those living nearby might leave more frequently due to convenience in finding other local opportunities or dissatisfaction with their current role.
Gender: Male attrition being nearly double that of females might reflect industry-specific dynamics or varying expectations and career aspirations.
Departments: High turnover in Sales and R&D could be due to performance pressures, competitive job markets, or the fast-paced nature of these fields.
Understanding these patterns helps us identify areas for improvement in our retention strategies. By addressing these insights, we aim to enhance job satisfaction and create a more engaging and stable work environment for everyone.

Letâ€™s work together to foster a fulfilling workplace!
